## Why Pixel Icons?

I've always liked the 8-bit aesthetic, but I struggled to find a VS Code icon theme that felt truly complete.

Inspired by the excellent work of [Platinumaniac](https://github.com/Platinumaniac), I used their icons as a foundation and massively expanded the set. My goal is to cover most of the modern dev stack while keeping that crisp, hand-crafted retro feel. 🙂
